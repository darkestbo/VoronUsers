This mod allow users like me to use a different rail from MGN9H, like a MGN9C or (in my case) Schnebeerger MNN9-G3

You'll find the modified STL of the 'Pivot' 'a_drive_frame_upper' 'b_drive_frame_upper'

I'm still finding a way to modify the X carriage block, since it hasn't too much space in order to reduce the X interaxis of the M3 Holes of the rail. 
The sense of this mod is only because i had 8 Original Schnebeerger rails laying arounfd my workshop and since when i built the 2.4 i wasn't able to print ABS modified parts, i wanted to use them on my 1.8
I already printed myself the parts before publishing them, they fit perfectly even the pivot that is basically the same design as before but now is more lightweight.

Enjoy and let me know if there are problems.

PS: Temporaneally i'm still using the X carriage with a MNN9-G3 using only 2 M3 screw to fix it.. need to design a better system and then i'll update this!
